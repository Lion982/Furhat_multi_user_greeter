# Furhat_multi_user_greeter
This folder contains the commented live-control files plus this README.
The system is split into separate stages so each part has one clear job:
get frames and body keypoints
turn keypoints into SocialEgoNet predictions
turn predictions into robot behaviour
That makes it much easier to test and debug.
Files in the overall system
1. `demo_inference_furhat.py`
This is the front end of the perception pipeline.
Its job is to:
connect to Furhat and request live camera frames
run AlphaPose on each frame
separate detections by person
write one JSON file per person in the custom format used by the next stage
In simple terms, this file answers:
"Who is in front of the robot, and what are their body keypoints over time?"
---
2. `prediction.py`
This is the simple offline prediction script.
Its job is to:
load a folder of pose JSON files
build a SocialEgoNet dataloader
run the model on each sample
take the top class from each output using `argmax`
save the final labels to `predictions.json`
It outputs:
`intention`
`attitude`
`action`
It does not:
send live messages to Furhat
estimate a head target for Furhat to look at
track whether a person has disappeared
create a special live `interacting = Yes/No` control field
smooth or stabilise behaviour over time
In simple terms, this file answers:
"If I run SocialEgoNet on saved pose files, what class labels do I get?"
---
3. `realtime_predict_ws_furhat_v5.py`
This is the live prediction stage.
Its job is to:
watch the JSON files written by the AlphaPose stage
pull out the newest sequence of frames for each person
convert those frames into the graph input SocialEgoNet expects
run SocialEgoNet live
predict intention, attitude, and action
turn those outputs into a simpler live control label such as `interacting = Yes/No`
estimate a sensible point for Furhat to look at
send the result to the robot-side controller
In simple terms, this file answers:
"Out of the people currently visible, who looks like they want to interact right now?"
---
4. `robot_intention_server_furhat_v5_speak.py`
This is the robot behaviour stage.
Its job is to:
receive live prediction messages
keep track of all visible people
decide who Furhat should focus on right now
send `attend.location`, `attend.nobody`, and `speak.text` commands to Furhat
briefly acknowledge a second person if someone else is already being served
In simple terms, this file answers:
"Given the predictions, what should the robot do right now?"
---
Full data flow
The whole live system works like this:
Furhat camera provides live images.
`demo_inference_furhat.py` runs AlphaPose and writes per-person JSON files.
`realtime_predict_ws_furhat_v5.py` reads those JSON files and runs SocialEgoNet.
It sends one live message per person to `robot_intention_server_furhat_v5_speak.py`.
The robot-side file decides where Furhat should look and what it should say.
Furhat moves its head and speaks through the Realtime API.
The offline path is simpler:
Pose JSON files already exist.
`prediction.py` loads them through the dataset/dataloader.
It outputs one set of labels per file.
Nothing is sent to the robot.
---
Why `prediction.py` and `realtime_predict_ws_furhat_v5.py` are different
These two files both use SocialEgoNet, but they are for different jobs.
`prediction.py`
This is mainly for offline testing.
It takes each model output and simply chooses the biggest logit using `argmax`.
That gives one final label for:
intention
attitude
action
This is fine when you only want saved predictions from saved files.
`realtime_predict_ws_furhat_v5.py`
This is for live robot control.
A live robot needs more than just three class labels. It also needs to know:
is the person still present?
should I treat this person as interacting right now?
where should I look?
has the result been stable for long enough?
So the realtime file adds extra live logic on top of the raw model output.
---
Very simple explanation of the 0.9 probability rule
When we used the more direct logic from `prediction.py`, the live system became less accurate in practice.
That happened because `prediction.py` just takes the top class. In live use, the top class can flip on noisy frames, especially when the model is not strongly sure.
So in `realtime_predict_ws_furhat_v5.py`, we made the rule more careful:
only say `interacting = No` if `P(Not_Interested) >= 0.90`
and `P(Not_Interacting) >= 0.90`
otherwise keep `interacting = Yes`
This means:
a person is only marked as not interacting when the model is very confident in both of the negative signals
if the model is unsure, the robot does not give up too easily
A very simple way to think about it is:
Old idea:
"Whichever class is biggest wins immediately."
New idea:
"Only call someone not interacting when the model is really sure."
This was added because the direct argmax-style approach worked less well for the live system.
---
Why this makes sense in a live system
A live system is noisier than an offline script.
Small changes in pose, missed keypoints, short partial views, or awkward frames can make the top class jump around.
The interaction-initiation paper also shows that this kind of timing decision is not perfectly stable, and that some classes are harder to separate than others. The timing classifier achieved about 73.6% accuracy overall, with a lower macro F1 of 69%, and the paper notes that one class is harder to distinguish because the difference can be very small. That is another reason to be more conservative in the live robot controller. fileciteturn5file12
So the 0.9 rule is basically a confidence check to stop the robot from switching to `No` too easily.

How `prediction.py` works
The script:
loads the config
builds a `JPL_Social_Dataset`
builds a `JPL_Social_DataLoader`
loads the trained SocialEgoNet checkpoint
runs the model on each batch
uses `torch.argmax(...)` for intention, attitude, and action
saves the final labels to a JSON file
It does not calculate softmax probabilities for decision-making. It just picks the index of the largest output for each task. fileciteturn5file0
---
How `realtime_predict_ws_furhat_v5.py` works
This file is designed for live use rather than offline evaluation.
Main loop
For every JSON file in the watched folder, it:
loads the file safely
checks whether the file is stale
extracts the newest `sequence_length` frames
skips the file if nothing new has appeared
converts the pose window into graph data
runs SocialEgoNet
applies `softmax` so the outputs become probabilities
calculates `p_not_interested` and `p_not_interacting`
uses the 0.9 thresholds to decide `interacting = Yes/No`
estimates a target point for Furhat to look at
sends the message onward
Unlike `prediction.py`, this file does use softmax probabilities and a special binary control rule for interaction. It sets `interacting = No` only when both negative probabilities are above the chosen thresholds, which default to 0.90. fileciteturn5file2 fileciteturn5file6
Why there is a stability buffer
The script keeps short histories for `intention` and `interacting`.
That allows it to compute `stable_intention` and `stable_interacting` when the same result repeats.
This is useful because single updates can be noisy.
Extra live checks
The realtime file also:
marks a person absent if their file stops updating
can refuse to say `Yes` if there is no valid head target
sends target coordinates for Furhat head movement
These are all things the offline script does not need. fileciteturn5file5 fileciteturn5file6
---
How `demo_inference_furhat.py` works
This script requests frames from Furhat using the Realtime API.
Each frame is passed through the AlphaPose pipeline:
person detection
crop / transform
pose model forward pass
heatmap decoding
optional tracking
The results are repacked into the custom JSON format.
Important behaviour in this file
each run gets a new timestamped prefix
each person gets their own JSON file
a person only becomes a saved JSON once they have been seen for enough frames
short false detections are kept out by `person_min_frames`
This stage is mostly about producing stable pose sequences for later prediction. fileciteturn5file18
---
How `robot_intention_server_furhat_v5_speak.py` works
This file is the decision layer between predictions and robot actions.
Person memory
The file stores the latest message for each visible person in `latest_by_person`.
That means Furhat can compare people instead of reacting only to the newest message.
Locking onto one person
The main idea is that Furhat should usually have one current person it is serving.
That person is stored in `locked_person_id`.
A person can become the lock if:
they are present
they are predicted as interacting
they have a valid target point to look at
Releasing the lock
The lock is dropped if:
the person goes stale
the person disappears
the person has not been interacting for long enough
Head movement
The script does not send every tiny movement directly to Furhat.
It first:
converts image coordinates into robot coordinates
smooths the movement
ignores tiny changes using deadbands
rate-limits how often commands are sent
This is why the head movement looks steadier. fileciteturn5file13 fileciteturn5file19
Greeting logic
When Furhat chooses a new primary person, it can say the main greeting.
A cooldown stops it from repeating the greeting too often.
Second-person acknowledgement
If one person is already being served and another person starts interacting,
Furhat can briefly:
glance at the second person
say a waiting message
return to the first person
That behaviour is handled in a separate async task so the main message loop keeps running. fileciteturn5file16 fileciteturn5file17

Typical run order
Start the scripts in this order:
start the robot-side server: `robot_intention_server_furhat_v5_speak.py`
start the live predictor: `realtime_predict_ws_furhat_v5.py`
start the Furhat/AlphaPose capture script: `demo_inference_furhat.py`
For offline testing only:
make sure the pose JSON files already exist
run `prediction.py`
inspect the output JSON
